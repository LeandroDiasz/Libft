# Libft

Welcome to my Libft repository!

## Project Overview

Libft is a project from Ecole 42 that aims to build a library of common C functions that can be reused in future projects. Since most 42 projects do not allow the use of standard C library functions, this first project challenges us to recreate some of these essential functions from scratch, along with additional utility functions.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to:

- Replicate a selection of standard C library functions.
- Implement additional utility functions that will be useful in subsequent projects.
- Gain a deeper understanding of how these functions work and improve our C programming skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/LeandroDiasz/Libft.git>
cd libft
